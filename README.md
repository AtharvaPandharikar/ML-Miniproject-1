TITLE:
    Build a Machine Learning Placement Prediction. Placement Prediction data (sr.no, gender, ssc_p, .....etc)

PREDICTING PLACEMENT IN CAMPUS RECRUITMENT:
    As we all know that in every college there are on-Campus placements. For that they collect Students educational information from 10 th onwards. On the basis of Qualification, Aptitude test, Group Discussion and tests students are being selected for campus. We are having dataset for campus . Student details are given including marks, grades, specialization and many more.
Based on this features we have to predict whether the student will be placed or not. So by using ML Algorithm we will be predicting student will be placed or not.

Project Description
Campus recruitment is an Public dataset. In this dataset there are total 15 features and 215 data-points. This dataset contains students data that has education information of each student starting from school to degree completion.
So we have student educational info like ssc marks, hsc marks, degree percentage, mba percentage etc. On this basis we have to find the status whether he will get placed or not through the campus.

Here target variable is “status” column. We have to clean the data and apply all the algorithms to our model and check which one gives maximum accuracy.
